			<p>I started SyncBase as an alternative to what was dropbox when I was
using it. I could use it to keep backup of my files and I could share
them. It was an easy way to have a static website.</p>
<p>But with time, both me and dropbox changed and keep drifting away. I
started using some less mainstream operating system which weren't
supported. Dropbox removed the ability to display html page. Then it
removed entirely the ability to share raw content.</p>
<p>I miss the service I was using. And I doubt I'm the only one, it was one
of the recommended way of sharing twine story for example. Here come
syncbase.</p>
<p>The plan is to assemble a bunch of tools to have the mix of features I'm
after and make it possible to share an installation with other people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncthing will handle synchronizing files between multiple machines</li>
<li>Httpd will serve a sub directory to the web.</li>
<li>A web application will handle user creation and offer file access on
   the go.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using real user on the system should keep things like file quota simple
and might make possible to offer ssh shell or email later.</p>
